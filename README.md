#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Cardiovascular Disease is the leading cause of death in the US. This question is important because it can help with detecting the first possible signs of such disease in a patient. This can help doctors and patients pursue further testing to confirm the diagnosis and begin early actions in treating a patient's cardiovascular disease. This analysis will help by allowing non-AI/ML personnel to input the values of the specific demographic and vital signs variables and determine if there would be the possibility of cardiovascular disease.

#### Research Question
Based on patients' demographics and vital signs data, can we predict the presence of cardiovascular disease? 

#### Data Sources
For this project, my dataset was ontained from Kaggle.com. The specific link is [Cardiovascular Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset).

#### Methodology
Provided that the outcome variable is binary and that this dataset is quite large, I will be using Logistic Regression.
Upon analysis of the dataset, I had noted significant outliers and issues with the data. I decided that the analysis would be specifically regarding subjects with a height between 140cm and 200sm, weight greater than 45kg, Systolic Blood Pressure between 90mmHg and 180mmHg and Diastolic Blood Pressure between 60mmHg and 120mmHg.
